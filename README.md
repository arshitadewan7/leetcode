# LeetCode Solutions in C++

Welcome to my LeetCode repository! This is where I store my personal solutions to LeetCode problems, all written in **C++**.

The goal is to improve my problem-solving skills, understand algorithms and data structures more deeply, and keep track of my progress over time.

---

## 🗂️ Structure

- All solutions are written in **C++**.
- Solutions are organized in folders by **problem topic** or **sheet**.
- Some curated question sets like **Blind 75** and **Striver’s SDE Sheet** are separated into different **branches**.

---

## 🌿 Branches

This repository may include separate branches for focused practice sets:

| Branch Name        | Description                                     |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `main`             | General LeetCode practice (by topic/difficulty) |
| `blind75`          | Solutions to the famous Blind 75 problems       |
| `striver-sde`      | Solutions from Striver’s SDE Sheet              |
| `neetcode150`      | NeetCode 150 practice                           |

Use `git checkout branch-name` to switch between them.


Each solution may include:
- **C++ source file**
- Comments explaining the approach
- (Optional) Time and space complexity
